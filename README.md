Scripts and Configurations fortools I use

## valgrind-program-tester

Is meant to make testing for memory leaks with Valgrind easier by:
- running a program as many times as there are argument sets
- highlighting when there are leaks or no leaks, while not printing any extra info
- generating a report of how many leaking tests there were
- writing the logs to a file for each test for later revision

Inside the script there is :
- an executable variable name to set as the program name to test with
- arguments to set that the script should run the program with

## vim

Make vim more enjoyable to use (for me).
