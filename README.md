[TODO add screenshots]

This is for zsh (shell).

Is meant to make testing for memory leaks with Valgrind easier by:
- running a program as many times as there are argument sets
- highlighting when there are leaks or no leaks, while not printing any extra info
- generating a report of how many leaking tests there were
- writing the logs to a file for each test for later revision


Inside the script there things that should be edited for your needs:
- an executable variable name to set as the program name
- arguments to set that the script should run the program with

## vim
